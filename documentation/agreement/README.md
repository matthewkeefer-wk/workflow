Team Agreement
===============================
[Back to Docs Home](../README.md)

This is a living document to outline the various processes and agreements we have as a group. These are meant to be best practices rather than enforcable. We're all adults. If unsure, communicate.

These documents have been updated from SkaarDB:

* [Pull Requests](PULL_REQUESTS.md)
* [Code Review](CODE_REVIEW.md)
* [Release Process](RELEASE_STRATEGY.md)
* [Meetings](MEETINGS.md)
* [JIRA Tickets](TICKETS.md)

These are still direct copies of SkaarDB's Team Agreement:

* [Product Management](PRODUCT_MANAGEMENT.md)
* [Delivery Management](DELIVERY_MANAGEMENT.md)
* [User Experience](USER_EXPERIENCE.md)
* [Prototype vs Production Code](PROTOTYPE_VS_PRODUCTION.md)
* [Code Standards](CODE_STANDARDS.md)
* [Dependencies](DEPENDENCIES.md)
* [Testing Process](TESTING_PROCESS.md)
* [Merge Process](MERGE_PROCESS.md)
* [Types of Tests](TYPES_OF_TESTS.md)
* [Support / Monitoring / Feedback](SUPPORT_MONITORING_FEEDBACK.md)


### Change process

- Make a PR
- Ask for discussion
- Open PRs will be discussed at Retro for closing

### Existing Parking Lot

- PR template should have room to BE DESCRIPTIVE
- Branching strategy. Master has to always be releasable. 
- Contract testing in order to address dependent services
- Ping each other when we’re deploying something that might break something else
- What even are stories?
- Standup rules. Some people want to dump the JIRA board from the standup.
- IS it scottsfam or AZfam? Or 🌵?
- JIRA Columns and workflow
- Commit comments should have a ticket number on them
- Each repo has a CONTRIBUTING.md
- Checkstyle. Possibly belongs in Contributing.
- Testing requirements should be documented in the repo
